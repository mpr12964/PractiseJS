Day 11: 

1) Create a closure function as a class to create employee object .(properties and all functions should be private).
write method in the above function which can access to outer world as it can access the all private members of the above class.

2) Write a closure which has a private variable initialised to 0.
 Return an object which contains four methods each takes a paramter and perform a mathematical operation with avilable private varible and return the result.
 Also provide a method to get &  update private variable value.

Day 12: 

1) Create a   counter function using closure concept.
2) Create a function with private properties such productId , name, price, 
   return an object contains methods to access the properties in the above function.
  
3) create an object having 2  properties, one contains array of numbers. the other  is a method is used to calculate the sum of the array elements in the above mentioned property.

4) Create a new  student object which has properties such as name,rollno, markes in one property.
5) Caclaute the sum of marks by using call and apply methods.
6) Try to create a counter using IIFE.


Day 13:

1) Create a Student class(function) to add the instance properties such as name, age, course, address:{landMark, street, city, state, country }

Create 2 objects by using the student class (use new ) with diffirent values.
Save them to localStorage and sessionStorage and extract them back into two different references.

2) Create copy of one of the above object.
3) Try the above once using sessionStorage also.

Day 14:
/************* Use only let and const  to write below programmes *********/
1) Write two functions to calculate the area and perimeter of a circle takes the radius as parameter.

2) Write a function to create a copy of an object by iterating over the keys of an it.
3) Write a function to print the output as follows for the given no of rows with a given character.(given rows count is 6 and character is *){ two params (count, character)}
*

4) Write a function to create a copy of an existing array (pass as parameter) and return the new copy of the array (if provided takes second and third paramters from position and to position).

 Write the above programme in all possible ways.

5) Write a function which maintains an array and the function returns an object in which we will be having four functions one for each operation
push ,pop, shift , unshift and a function to view the array elements.

Day 15:
/*************** Arrow functions   ************************/
1) In the given array, list out all even numbers (use arrow function in possible ways in writing this code)
2) Write a programe to display numbers from 1 to 10 ,to dispaly each value it takes 5 seconds time between the any two values. {using arrow function}
3) Use arrow functions as call back function for the available array functions { write  atleast 4 arrow functions} .
4) 
Day 16:
/***************  Object destructering  ************************/
1) var emp = {id: 1234, name: "Rajsekhar" ,address: {city: "Sydney", country: "Aus"}};
   i) Extract properties : id, name  into local variables from the  above object.
   ii) Write code to extract the id, name into local variables such as empId, empName.


2) Create local variables which holds the array elements from index positions : 2, 5, 7, 9, 10 
var arr = ["R", "H", "L", "N", "O", "U", "E", "Q", "D"]

3) Write a function which takes paramater emp object and extracts address into the local variable "address" in that function and
log all the enumerable properties of that address in that function.

4) Write a function which takes paramater emp object and extracts address, ame, id, grade, joblevel 
{assign some default values for all of them if they are not exist}   in that function.
Construct an emp object locally in that function with the properties extracted into local variables.

5) In question no: 2 {assign default values for all of the local variables check which is assigned which default value which one is not}
